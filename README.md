# ðŸŒµ database-wrapper
A very old project of mine but that I think will save some lives... it is a system that facilitates the use of databases (MySQL and SQLITE), based on primary keys, its use is recommended for simple and non-relational projects (but it is suitable for passing the limits) It is aimed at the spigot
## How to use?
First of all, create a constructor for your database, it could be in your main class or somewhere else, because you'll need it...

#### StorageBuilder
```java
Database database = new StorageBuilder(DatabaseType.SQLITE) // Or MYSQL
  .setConnectionData(new File(System.getProperty("user.dir"))) // Or "host" "database" "username" "password"
  .useSingleThreadQueue(10) // This is optional, I will explain soon
  .selectDatabaseModel(new StoreClass()) // Here you initialize the class that has the sql creation methods
  .build(); // Returns with the database object
```

#### Connection data (setConnectionData)
<strong>setConnectionData</strong> defines the connection parameters, if you use SQLITE, pass a path where the file will be created, just the path, because it already creates a directory and file, if you use MYSQL, put the main connection data in the parameters
```java
.setConnectionData(new File(System.getProperty("user.dir")))
```

```java
.setConnectionData("host" "database" "username" "password")
```

#### Blocked Queue to store data (useSingleThreadQueue)
<strong>useSingleThreadQueue</strong> Here I made a queue that runs every second, which is defined by the user, now why is that? in spigot connections with databases are a bit complicated and sometimes misused, I made this tool for the data to be saved after a while so as not to disturb other server events like another connection, imagine, two plugins saving heavy data at the same time.
```java
.useSingleThreadQueue(10) // 10 is the number of seconds
```

#### Predefined class for storage (selectDatabaseModel)
<strong>selectDatabaseModel(new Class())</strong> This new Class() is a class that the user will create containing the table creation methods and other things he wants to implement... to use it, you need to extend the DatabaseModel and pass the @StoreVoid annotation so that when the class is initialized it can identify the methods to create the query

```java
import com.github.nexy.database.annotations.StoreVoid;
import com.github.nexy.database.components.DataComponent;
import com.github.nexy.database.components.Table;
import com.github.nexy.database.constants.ComponentType;
import com.github.nexy.database.model.DatabaseModel;

import java.util.Arrays;

public class YourStorageClass extends DatabaseModel {

    @StoreVoid
    public void initAnyTable() {
        this.createTable(new Table(
          "master_table",
          Arrays.asList(
            new DataComponent("column", ComponentType.TEXT),
            new DataComponent("column2", ComponentType.INTEGER)
          )
        ));
        // do your thing here
    }

    @StoreVoid
    public void initOtherTable() {
        this.createJsonTable(new Table("helloA")); // I'll explain later
        // do your thing here
    }

}
```

#### The database object (This part is cool)
Come on, the database object is basically the queries but with methods and much better, let's face it, with it we can save objects in our database, what do you mean objects? If my object only has primary objects such as String, int, UUID, List and the like, it is possible to place it in the database without having to create several columns for this. We also have Async methods for asynchronous developments (Based onCompleteFuture<K>)
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Standard methods</strong>
```java
database.set("uniqueValue", "column", "int/string/any", "table");
```
```java
database.get("uniqueValue", "column", "table");
```
```java
database.delete("uniqueValue", "table");
```

<br/>
<strong>Saving objects + Async + Blocked Queue</strong>
<br/>

```java
database.setAsyncWithJson("uniqueValue", new PlayerAccount("playerName", 1000), "table")
    .thenAccept((voidAction) -> System.out.println("OK"));
```

```java
database.createAsync("uniqueValue", "table").thenAccept((voidAction) -> System.out.println("OK"));
```

```java
database.createAsyncWithJson("uniqueValue", "table").thenAccept((voidAction) -> {
    database.saveLater("uniqueValue", new PlayerAccount("DevNexy", 1000), "table");
});
```
<br/>
<strong>Loading data</strong>
<br/>

```java
database.eachPrimaryKey("table").forEach((uniqueValue) -> {
    Object fromDb = database.get(uniqueValue, "column", "table");
    // do your thing here
});
```
